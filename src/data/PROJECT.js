        text: `Venice is probably the most famous and iconic city in the world, one
                of the oldest artificial islands ever built. For more than 15
                centuries Venice has stood as a testament to construction innovation
                and technology, but also art, architecture and luxury lifestyle.\n\n
                Venice is more than just a location, it’s a way of life, a unique
                state of mind, a city with a very delicate balance between water and
                land, nature and technology, traditional and contemporary art and
                events.\n\n
                With the Submerged Venice we are proposing and enhancing
                this way of life. The project is a floating masterplan with a
                built-up area of 70,000 m2, that includes 20,000 m2 of underwater
                experience directly open to the ocean. A new way to experience the
                relationship between man and water.`,

                block your view... a shelter of privacy within the comfort of a
                community.\n\n We imagine a green mountain, a summer bright afternoon in
                the lower alps, overlooking the rows of wine yards sliding down gently
                towards the Lac Leman shore... We remember the summer swims at the
                floating platforms at Frauenbad Stadhousquai in Zürich... the wooden
                Rivas sailing across Luzern Lake from shore to shore...\n\n We rescue from
                our Swiss summer memories the long trekkings searching for small
                waterfalls... the walks through the green slopes of bright green grass
                ... Discovering Ice caves with stalactites of frozen water...`,

                re-designed Rooms, Suites and a whole brand new 1800 m2 super
                exclusive villa at the top of the building.\n\n A massive workload in a
                super-tight time schedule, designing even when the construction phase
                was already started. A whole challenge to our offices which had to
                provide updated construction documents and on site supervision on a
                daily basis.`,

                enades and walks beside the sea, colorful facades and small coastal
                towns... are the essence of the Mediterranean Cote D’Azur.\n\n Light and
                color. Sun reflections on facades, brightness... Let’s paint in a
                different way. Let’s tell the kaleidoscopic story of the colorful Cote
                d’Azur facades deconstructing it into changing reflections, changing
                tones... as the observer moves in front of the building. We will build
                a modern construction which evokes the vernacular facades in bits and
                pieces... flashes, glares and painted spaces in light and color.\n\n To
                achieve this illusion we are using a dichroic film in the galss slats
                of the façade. This film de-composes the colors depending on the angle
                from which is perceived, creating a short of always changing range of
                colors as light and observer progresses in time and space.`,

                Venice, hosting long beaches, an ancient tradition of spas and thermal
                waters represented at its maximum splendor in the Excelsior Palace

                wrapped Venice’s Grand Canal around Floating Venice project, we
                adjusted the real lido outline along the borders of our plot, creating
                a new façade towards the open sea, and a private enclosed water area
                between the new project and Floating Venice. In a short of Yin-Yang
                equilibrium of opposites, the external shore is dedicated to a super
                yacht marina and its services, while the interior one overlooking the
                hotel resort, turns into a dune landscape of long white sandy beaches.
                The project dives into the Persian gulf to provide an spectacular
                underwater theatre, a convention center, restaurants and a unique
                submerged spa experience.`,
